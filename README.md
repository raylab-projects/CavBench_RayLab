# CavBench_RayLab
CavBench is a generic benchmarking tool to compare different protein cavity detection methods.

To run CavBench based on C++, access the "c++" folder.  
To run CavBench based on Python, access the "python" folder.  
As of now, the execution of the Python code is slower as compared to the C++ code due to Python's file handling.  

Follow the README inside each of the folder for further instructions.
